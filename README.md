## Keira2 the TrinityCore Database Web-Editor

This software is a Database Editor web application for the [TrinityCore MMORPG framework](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore) built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and using the [TrinityCore JSON RESTful API](https://github.com/ShinDarth/TC-JSON-API/) to retrieve database data.

Keira2 allows the user to **edit the database via GUI** and **generates automatically the SQL code** for him/her. It is inspired by the old **Quice/Truice** database editor, originally developed by **indomit**, and by the [Discover-'s SAI Editor](https://github.com/Discover-/SAI-Editor).

Using Keira2, you can edit **SmartAI**, **Quests**, **Creatures**, **Spawns**, **Loots**, **GameObjects**, **Items**, **Characters**, etc...

Also you can change the GUI style choosing a different **graphic theme** using the theme-switcher button. There are several themes, light and dark ones.

## Live demo

A live demo is available [here](https://keira2.altervista.org/Keira2-dev/). You can use it for production but be aware that its database may not be updated to the latest version. (Current Version: [TDB](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/issues/14421) 335.59)

Also you can **help us** by testing the development version **without installing it**, simply using our [development live demo](http://keira2.altervista.org/Keira2-dev/). Remember to **clear your browser cache** before testing it and [report any bug or suggestion](https://github.com/Helias/Keira2/issues/new).

## Installation

Keira2 fetches data from an istance of the [TrinityCore JSON API](https://github.com/ShinDarth/TC-JSON-API/), it can be installed either on the same machine or on an external one.

You can install an istance of the TrinityCore JSON API using [this guide](https://github.com/ShinDarth/TC-JSON-API/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

Once you have installed the API, download the [latest release of Keira2](https://github.com/Helias/Keira2/releases) and extract the Keira2 folder and place is inside your web server directory (e.g. /var/www/).

Then open the Keira2 folder and copy the file config.js.dist to config.js, open it and set it properly with the path of the API:

`app.api = "../TC-JSON-API/public/index.php/";`

replace "../TC-JSON-API/public/index.php/" with the path of your API istance.

If you have the TrinityCore JSON API on an external machine, you should set it like:

`app.api = "http://www.your.external.server.org/path/to/TC-JSON-API/public/index.php/";`
